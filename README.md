# real-time-backend-architecture

Production-grade backend architecture blueprint
supporting REST APIs and real-time WebSocket communication.

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture.png)

## Purpose

This repository documents a production-grade backend architecture
designed to support:

- Secure REST APIs
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Scalable data access with caching
- Clear separation of concerns

The goal is to serve as:
- A system design reference
- A blueprint for future implementation
- An architectural discussion artifact
